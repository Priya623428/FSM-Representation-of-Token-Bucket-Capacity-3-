# FSM-Representation-of-Token-Bucket-Capacity-3-
This project presents an original model of the Token Bucket Algorithm using a Finite State Machine (FSM) with a bucket capacity of 3 tokens. The goal is to visually and logically represent how data or requests are controlled in network and web systems to prevent overload and ensure smooth traffic flow.
